A man walked down a road and discovered a coin on the ground. The coin had a detailed inscription on it that the man could not read. He picked it up and turned it over in his hand a couple times. One side was extremly smooth to the touch and reflected brightly. Then man took the coin back to his house to study it more closely.

When he got home, the man set the coin on his desk under a magnifying glass to get a better look. However, after closer examination, the man realized the coin had changed.
What was once a smooth, reflective side was now rough and riddled with rust and grime. Puzzled, the man flipped the coin over to see if he could read the inscription.
To his undending surprise, the inscription was now gone and replaced with the face of a roaring bear. He could see the bear had sharp teeth with what looked like saliva
or maybe even blood dripping from its mouth. The man became frightened as he began to believe the coin he picked up was cursed.
